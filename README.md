# GifTastic

In this assignment, you'll use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. To finish this task, you must call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of your site.


GifTastic is an app that shows you gifs on 90's tv shows. You can also enter your own favorite show in the add cartoon box to see gifs you want to see.
